# TalkitOut
Mental health awareness is a buzzing topic. There have been a lot of awareness camps and innovative events happening on campus. Most mental illnesses in students occur due to anxiety and bottling up thoughts. They have no one suitable to talk to. Sometimes just talking out is all a student needs. So to help students in distress or who just need someone to talk to, we have come up with an idea to build an application for students to book appointments with volunteers when in need. This application matches students and volunteers based on a matching algorithm that incorporates common parameters to give a score. The volunteer with maximum score for a student gets matched to the student. Both volunteer and student can meet post that. This application is called TALKITOUT.
